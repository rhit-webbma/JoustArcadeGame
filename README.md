# JoustArcadeGame
## Description
This is a simple Java Swing project to emulate the 1982 Arcade Game Joust. Given that this was one of my first games made using Java Swing, I realized very quickly that 
- Java Swing is very finicky when it comes to displaying graphics the way you want, which taught me and my projcet partner Christina how to navigate a plethora of documentation to get excatly what we wanted
- With this being my first java game project I learned a lot about how to stucture classes based on a game objects specific role
- I also learned a significant amount in communicating with a partner and assigning tasks to eachother based on specialities and preferences

One of my favorite things that I did in this project was use text generated in a .txt file to make each level.

Each of the levels are populated from a text file and everything on the screen is populated based on this legend

- Hyphen : This would represent a platform that the hero can stand on.
- H : This represents where the hero itself would spawn
- S : This represents where a shooter type of monster would spawn, which shoots little pellets that damage the player
- F : This represents where a "follow the player" type of monster would spawn.

With this legened we created 4 levels, and here are 2 that were generated based off of their respective text files

*Give a little liberty on enemies because a little bit of the game was played before I could quickly screenshot*

## How to Use
This is a very simple project so all you have to do is
1. Clone the project from the repo
2. Import it into a Java-Friendly IDE
3. Run as a Java Project

This screen should come up when you successfully run it

## How to Play
This game functions exactly how the previous game should of course with our own creative liberties.
1. You need to be above an enemy when touching it to kill it
2. When you kill an enemey an egg with drop
3. Collect this egg before it hatches back into an ostrich
4. Kill all of the enemies on the screen to advance to the next level.
